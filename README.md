## Instructions

## Notes
* if you want to make a patch or put method to a specified request api url to a postman, 
1. Just spoof the method by still using the POST method, but in the form-data you should 
create a key named `_method` and a value either `PUT` or `PATCH`, and  
2. Uncheck or remove the Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded in headers
